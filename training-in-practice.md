# Training in Practice

## 🐾 Training in Practice

Theories don’t change behaviour. **Practice does.**\
But not just any practice – **regulated, connected, purpose-driven training**.

In NeuroBond, training isn’t about reps and drills. It’s about **state shaping** – guiding your dog into regulated emotional and behavioural states, and holding them there long enough to anchor learning.

### 🧭 The 4 Pillars of Practical NeuroBond Training

1. **Environment Before Engagement**
   * Don’t fight distractions – **shape the environment**
   * Choose calm settings first. Then layer complexity slowly.
   * The dog’s brain learns best when it feels safe.
2. **Clarity in Movement**
   * Move first. Speak second.
   * Your steps, posture, and orientation communicate more than any word.
   * Dogs follow bodies, not voices.
3. **Structured Freedom**
   * Freedom is earned, not given.
   * Off-leash access starts only when the **invisible leash is active**
   * A dog in freedom without clarity = confusion with momentum
4. **Short Sessions, Long Bond**
   * 8–15 minutes of high-quality training beats 45 minutes of noise
   * End sessions with emotional success, not technical perfection
   * **State at the end = memory that remains**

### 🎬 Practical Examples

* Walk in heel → stop → eye contact → praise
* Recall cue → dog hesitates → you wait → dog returns → calm “Yes”
* Dog is reactive → you ground yourself → create space → leash stays loose

**Every interaction is a chance to either guide or confuse.**\
NeuroBond helps you **guide – without overloading**.

### 🧠 Mistake Handling

Dogs will make mistakes. That’s how they learn.\
But how _you_ respond will determine whether:

* They grow from it
* Or shut down under it

Use mistakes as:

* A chance to recalibrate the environment
* A cue to slow down the session
* A signal to reinforce earlier layers of the bond

> “Your dog isn’t testing you. They’re telling you what they don’t understand yet.”

### ✅ Summary

* Train for **state, not tricks**
* Prioritise **movement, tone, and timing**
* Let every session end in **clarity and calm**

Coming up next: real-world **Case Studies** showing how this plays out in behaviour rehabilitation, recall, and anxiety work.
