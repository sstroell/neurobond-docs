# Glossary

## 📘 NeuroBond Glossary

Below are key terms used throughout the NeuroBond Method. Each term reflects a core principle in how we communicate, shape, and bond with our dogs – beyond obedience, into alignment.

***

### 🧬 NeuroBond

The invisible alignment between dog and human – built through emotional clarity, nervous system regulation, and meaningful interaction.\
**Not control. Not domination. Connection.**

***

### 🪶 Invisible Leash

The felt connection that replaces the physical leash.\
When active, the dog orients to the human's body, energy, and tone – not because they’re forced, but because they want to.

***

### ✨ Soul Recall

A recall rooted in relationship.\
It’s not just a cue – it’s a gravitational pull.\
When Soul Recall is trained, the dog returns even under distraction, because the bond is stronger than the trigger.

***

### 🎯 Feedback Mechanism

The real-time communication system of “Yes” and “No” – delivered with clarity, tone, and timing.\
It teaches the dog what to hold, what to change, and why – without fear or confusion.

***

### 🧠 Nervous System Synchrony

The dog’s state is shaped by your state.\
If you are calm and clear, they follow.\
If you are frantic or rigid, they resist.\
This is the core of emotional leadership.

***

### 📦 Structured Freedom

Freedom is earned through clarity, not given through wishful thinking.\
Dogs need clear rules and guidance to feel safe – and once that safety is built, freedom becomes sustainable.

***

### 🌀 State Shaping

Rather than drilling behaviours, we shape **emotional and attentional states**.\
A calm dog in focus learns faster than a stressed dog in motion.

***

### 🚦Moment of Pause

The second your dog pauses, or offers eye contact, is the **opening for influence**.\
This is when learning sticks – not in the command, but in the space around it.

***

### 🔁 Loop Logic

The NeuroBond feedback system works in loops:\
**Action → Feedback → Adjustment → Reinforcement**\
When repeated with clarity, the dog starts predicting success – and chooses it.

***

### ⚡ Tone over Command

What you say matters less than **how** you say it.\
In NeuroBond, tone carries the emotional voltage that determines if your message lands.

***

### 🧘 Handler Regulation

Your dog doesn’t need you to be perfect – they need you to be **regulated**.\
The clearer your inner state, the safer your dog feels.\
Training begins with you.
